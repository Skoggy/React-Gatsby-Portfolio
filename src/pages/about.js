                            My name is Christopher Skogstad and I am currently doing a web development coding bootcamp at Monash
                            University. I have been a welder for the past 12 years and decided that now was the time to make a
                            change
                            into a field that is not only a fast growing one, but also one that interests me greatly.

                            My goal is to get enough knowledge to be able to get a career in this industry, but I know that
                            this
                            field
                            is one of constant evolution and learning, and I will have to work hard for the rest of my life
                            to
                            learn
                            about these things, and this excites me.
